## Triangulating a polygonal mesh with generalised maps

For the implementation of a generalised map, the program written carries out the following steps:

1. read a 3D polygonal mesh from an OBJ file,
2. store the polygonal mesh in a generalised map,
3. output all the darts and cells from the generalised map to .csv files, and finally
4. output a triangulation of the polygonal mesh to a new OBJ file.
